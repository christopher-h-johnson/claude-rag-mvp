# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for an AWS-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot system that uses Claude 3 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock as the language model. The system provides a web-based chat interface with real-time responses, document search capabilities across PDF files stored in S3, and comprehensive user management features. The architecture prioritizes serverless components, cost optimization, and security while maintaining high performance and scalability.
